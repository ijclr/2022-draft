	The 2nd International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR) will be held in 
	<a href="https://www.cumberlandlodge.ac.uk/">Cumberland Lodge</a>, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom, 28-30 September 2022. 
	<br><br>		
	      The <a href="http://lr2020.iit.demokritos.gr">1st IJCLR</a> took place from 25-27 October 2021 (virtual).

        <br>
        The rapid progress in machine learning has been the primary
        reason for a fresh look in the transormative potential of AI as
        a whole during the past decade. A crucial milestone for taking
        full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms
        that learn from experience with the ability to consult existing
        knowledge and reason with what has already been learned.
        Integrating learning and reasoning constitutes one of the key
        open questions in AI, and holds the potential of addressing many
        of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the
        black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the
        difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light
        of new data. Integrating learning and reasoning calls for
        approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine
        reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of
        neural, statistical and relational learning.<br>
        <br>
        Four international conferences and workshops addressing such
        research topics join forces in the 2nd International Conference
        on Learning &amp; Reasoning (IJCLR 2022):<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The 31st International Conference on Inductive Logic
            Programming (ILP)</b> The ILP conference series has been the
          premier forum for work on logic-based approaches to learning
          for three decades. Originally focusing on the induction of
          logic programs, over the years it has expanded its research
          horizon to other forms of relational learning and to
          probabilistic approaches.</li>
        <li><b>The 16th International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic
            Learning &amp; Reasoning (NeSy)</b> The NeSy workshop series is 
		the longest standing gathering for the presentation and discussion of cutting edge research in 
		<a href="http://www.neural-symbolic.org/">neurosymbolic AI</a>. 
		NeSy is the yearly meeting of 
		the <a href="https://www.city-data-science-institute.com/nesy">Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Association</a>.</li>
        <li><b>The 11th International Workshop on Approaches and
            Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP)</b> The AAIP
          workshop series focuses on learning executable programs in
          arbitrary programming languages, from incomplete
          specifications. e.g. from examples of their input/output
          behaviour.</li>
        <li><b>The 3rd </b><b>International Workshop on Human-Like
            Computing (HLC) </b>

            machines with human-like perceptual, reasoning and learning
            abilities which support collaboration and communication with
            human beings. The workshop aim is to bring together leading
            experts in AI and Cognitive Science to investigate areas of
            fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and
            communicative skills can be studied and modelled
            computationally.<span> </span></span><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>IJCLR aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners
        working on various aspects of learning &amp; reasoning, via
        presentation of cutting-edge research on topics of special
        interest to the participating conferences/workshops. In addition
        to each of the four events' individual programs, which will be
        held in parallel, IJCLR aims to promote collaboration and
        cross-fertilization between different approaches and
        methodologies to integrating learning &amp; reasoning, via joint
        keynotes, panel discussions and poster sessions.<br>

      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Call for Papers<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Journal Track: IJCLR’s journal track, the special issue on
        Learning and Reasoning supported by the Machine Learning Journal
        (MLJ), is accepting paper submissions on regular cut-off dates
        since February 2020. Submissions are solicited on all aspects of
        Learning and Reasoning and topics where machine learning is
        combined with machine reasoning or knowledge representation.
        Papers are published online by MLJ upon acceptance and authors
        of accepted papers are invited to present their work at the
        conference. The upcoming cut-off dates for the journal track
        are: 1st Feb 2022, 1st May 2022, 1st Aug 2022.<br>
        <br>
        Conference Track: Each conference/workshop participating in
        IJCLR will be soliciting paper submissions on the topics of its
        interest. Accepted papers will be presented at IJCLR.
        Additionally, IJCLR features a “General Track” where authors are
        invited to submit work that is relevant to the conference but it
        does not necessarily fall within the scope of a particular
        workshop (ILP, NeSy, AAIP, HLC). Submission deadline: TBA<br>
        <br>
        Recently published papers Track: IJCLR solicits submissions of
        high-quality papers on combining learning and reasoning that
        have been recently published, or accepted for publication, by a
        first-class conference such as ECML/PKDD, ICML, KDD, ICDM, AAAI,
        IJCAI, etc., or journal such as MLJ, DMKD, JMLR etc. Papers will
        be accepted on the grounds of relevance and quality of the
        original publication venue. Accepted papers will be presented at
        IJCLR. Submission deadline: TBA<br>
        <br>
        Please follow the Call for Papers link for more information and
        guidelines on paper submissions to the IJCLR tracks.
